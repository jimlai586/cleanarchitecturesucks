# Clean Architecture Sucks 

This is a code review post I wrote on Medium. 
[The fall of the house of Clean](posts/2023-11-04_The-fall-of-the-house-of-Clean-74afa19644ec.html)

## Who am I? 
I'm probably the only person you can find that code-reviews Clean Architecture / DI / MVVM using Swift. 

## Why Swift?
Extension, value type, POP. It made above patterns obsolete. It called for something new.

## Why am I here?
Because I got banned on Medium. 

## How do you get banned on a platform that can talk about adult topics?
By saying codes are dumb.
[Stop abusing value types](posts/2023-12-06_Stop-abusing-value-type-7cf4f64f2015.html)

Note that I'm not saying people are dumb. On the contrary, they are shrewd businessman; 

but the product they are selling is redundant brute force wrapped in fancy pattern names. 

## What am I planning to do here?
At this stage, archiving. So people may find this resource online in the midst of overwhelming advertisement / promotion of "Clean", "MVVM", ... etc. 

Some of the most advertised Swift tutorials are plain lazy brute force. I'm hoping to provide an alternative that can show up on search.

For example, view model are useless in SwiftUI. [MVVM but without view model and without view!](posts/2022-11-22_MVVM-but-without-view-model--and-without-view--88bd85c3e4fa.html)

## Swift is different
It may be hard to believe how one can say Clean Architecture / MVVM is dog shit. 

I have practically written a book on this topic at this point by reviewing some of the "industry titans". 

The main reason is Swift. Extension and value type should completely change the way you structure your code, among other Swift features.

## Try it 
I archived my Medium posts in /posts. You can read it at your leisure. Note that some links may be broken since I got banned. 

It's safe to say at this point, almost a decade after Swift is born, I have some unique takes on usage of Swift that you won't find it anywhere else.
