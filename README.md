# Clean Architecture Sucks 

This is a code review post I wrote on Medium. 
[The fall of the house of Clean](https://swift2931.github.io/cleanarchitecturesucks/posts/2023-11-04_The-fall-of-the-house-of-Clean-74afa19644ec.html)

## Who am I? 
I'm probably the only person you can find that code-reviews Clean Architecture / DI / MVVM using Swift. 

## Why Swift?
Extension, value type, POP. It made above patterns obsolete. It called for something new.

## Why am I here?
Because I got banned on Medium. 

## How do you get banned on a platform that can talk about adult topics?
By saying codes are dumb.
[Stop abusing value types](https://swift2931.github.io/cleanarchitecturesucks/posts/2023-12-06_Stop-abusing-value-type-7cf4f64f2015.html)

Note that I'm not saying people are dumb. On the contrary, they are shrewd businessman; 

but the product they are selling is redundant brute force wrapped in fancy pattern names. 

## What am I planning to do here?
At this stage, archiving. So people may find this resource online in the midst of overwhelming advertisement / promotion of "Clean", "MVVM", ... etc. 

Some of the most advertised Swift tutorials are plain lazy brute force. I'm hoping to provide an alternative that can show up on search.

For example, view model are useless in SwiftUI. [MVVM but without view model and without view!](https://swift2931.github.io/cleanarchitecturesucks/posts/2022-11-22_MVVM-but-without-view-model--and-without-view--88bd85c3e4fa.html)

## Swift is different
It may be hard to believe how one can say Clean Architecture / MVVM is dog shit. 

I have practically written a book on this topic at this point by reviewing some of the "industry titans". 

The main reason is Swift. Extension and value type should completely change the way you structure your code, among other Swift features.

## Function-oriented POP
I archived my Medium posts in /posts. Here is [the list](https://swift2931.github.io/cleanarchitecturesucks/posts/index.html). 

Note that code snippets lost formatting, and some links may be broken since they are not hosted as intented. 

Over the course of a couple years, there's a new pattern emerging. You can actually see the evolution if you read the posts. 

I'm going to coin the term first, elaborate more if I can find a platform where I can speak more freely.
