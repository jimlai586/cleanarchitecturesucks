I’m saying this because it was a dumb shit.</p><p name="8518" id="8518" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The plot is that the resistance are retreating without success, and only managed to escape with a handful of people in the end.</p><p name="52ab" id="52ab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…wait, who the fuck are these people and who the fuck cares?</p><p name="b30a" id="b30a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There has been this arrogance since TFA that mysteries are best left unexplained to keep people intrigued, as they were first introduced into the OT. And they had the audacity to not explain anything in the second installment of the new trilogy.</p><p name="7dca" id="7dca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, you may argue that they actually revealed a lot, such as Luke’s backstory and Rey’s parents. No, and No. People are being trolled by Disney without knowing it. I know forced drama when I see one.</p><p name="2ea7" id="2ea7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Disney wants you to overlook lazy writing and plot holes by throwing smokescreens like everyone-can-be-jedi, sparks-of-rebels among other bullshits. They did it so blatantly at the end with the bloom-kid that looks like a new hope. But if you think about it, who the fuck is this kid and why the fuck should I care about? Am I supposed to be comforted by knowing that rebel didn’t just die out when this movie was about them dying out?</p><p name="89b2" id="89b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is just one the forced dramas that together combine to be the so-called plot. It is as if they started out with the emotional scenes they want to put it and just find some fillers to glue them together.</p><p name="9d2b" id="9d2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is, as our late friend Ackbar described, a trap!!!</p><h3 name="1b68" id="1b68" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Who the fuck is Rey</h3><p name="ba10" id="ba10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">No one. I think they intended to go this direction since TFA trailer.</p><figure name="0f42" id="0f42" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGbxmsDFVnE?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><figcaption class="imageCaption">She told you she is no one the first thing in trailer</figcaption></figure><p name="f25d" id="f25d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">With confirmation of this in TLJ , it seems plausible that they have been trolling Internet all this time. With the way they play this, they might be planning some big reveal in ep9, which would not be about Rey’s identity, but rather be about how the force awakening ties to how ordinary person can somehow have such power.</p><p name="cf27" id="cf27" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From a perspective, you may argue that they did not not tell you her backstory. They told you in TFA trailer.</p><p name="d449" id="d449" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But a blade cuts two ways. If Disney wants to play such origin story, then how or why the force awakens has better be god damn good. If it turns out that why Rey is so strong with the force is as Snoke indicated in TLJ, just to balance out the dark force that is Ben solo, I’d be so pissed.</p><p name="4123" id="4123" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m actually finding excuses for Disney as to why there hasn’t been a single explanation to why the force behaves this way unlike anything we had seen before the new trilogy. They didn’t explain shit in TLJ, so either ep9 reveal would be so rewarding worthy of years of waiting, or there is shit-storm coming.</p><h3 name="093e" id="093e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Luke Training Scene</h3><blockquote name="dd05" id="dd05" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3">I don’t believe it</blockquote><figure name="ed8c" id="ed8c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*uIGix4sot4rt4xynTEBnCw.jpeg" data-width="300" data-height="168" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uIGix4sot4rt4xynTEBnCw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">After 30 years, this is still the only arc they can think of for Luke.</figcaption></figure><p name="a766" id="a766" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Before TLJ, I was convinced that Luke would train Rey and together they would fight Snoke or whatever dark side villains.</p><p name="e78f" id="e78f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was mistaken. Rey was there to train Luke to recover from his failed assassination attempt toward his nephew in the middle of night tens of years ago.</p><p name="bd2d" id="bd2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wait, what!? <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Luke Skywalker?</em></p><p name="a37a" id="a37a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the dumbest shit of highest level. This is not some random soap opera in which you can just throw a redemption arc on any character.</p><p name="25b0" id="25b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Star Wars</em>, and that is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Luke Skywalker .</em></p><p name="d0eb" id="d0eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may justify it however you want, but <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dump shit</em> are two words that cover it nicely. Of all the ways Disney can spin a new trilogy, Disney chose the worst possible way and acted like it is fans’ fault that they hold Luke in such high regards.</p><p name="d138" id="d138" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What did Luke do in this film? Or in the past 30 years for that matter?</p><p name="29de" id="29de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He let Snoke and first-order rise to power.</p><p name="07e3" id="07e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He got bested by his nephew while sneaking into his tent in the middle night to sense the darkness in him when he could have just done that in broad day light during teaching. Then he let Kylo loose in galaxy after he killed some of his students and was in affiliation with Snoke.</p><p name="b4f2" id="b4f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His solution to all these is to retreat to some island and wait to die?</p><p name="2f9a" id="2f9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could go on about how Rey had to come to his island and lectured him about why this is not cool and still did nothing until Yoda had to show up and burn the house down with lightning bolt. But you get the point.</p><p name="cea1" id="cea1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this is not dumb and forced drama, I don’t know what is.</p><p name="439d" id="439d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He did not contribute anything to the plot, hell he didn’t even tell Rey what she should do, only what she should NOT do.</p><p name="7037" id="7037" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rey ended up just force-Skyping with boyfriend because she was too bored on the island and eventually took off to meet him.</p><p name="43c2" id="43c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Until the end of TLJ, the plot requires him to save the rebels from certain doom. The movie wanted me to believe his showing up and the subsequent dying meant something, but it did not.</p><p name="f103" id="f103" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Rebels are reduced to a handful of people, and their objective is not to win, hell not even to survive, but to accept defeat and hope in time rebels would rise again. This is the plot they are going with, while being bold, it is very risky in that it would backfire. In this case since rebels are already defeated, what is the stake here? A couple of rebels we don’t know, old Leia that audience expects to die anyway? Rey is in no danger; Finn is already committing suicide, not to mention his miraculous escape while dragging Rose from behind enemy lines which removes all tension; As for Pole, I’m sure he can take care of himself.</p><p name="f213" id="f213" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, there is no stake. Rebels saved here doesn’t change the fact they lost and could not recover from it. Disney tried to sell me that Luke buying time had a significance, well, I didn’t feel it at all.</p><p name="615c" id="615c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is a dumb shit because it has no tension, no stakes, no plausible motivation and backstory, Luke’s out of character, and worst of all, forced drama without a good build-up.</p><p name="1173" id="1173" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I only know one truth. Forcing a redemption arc on Luke is what cooperate sell-outs do when they need a drama and are not talented enough to come up with a good Star Wars story.</p><p name="b7cc" id="b7cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So here we are, two episodes in, all we got are rehashes and callbacks from previous trilogy, with forced dramas here and there.</p><p name="91b1" id="91b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Looking back, what is the most original, creative stuff shown in ep7 and 8?</p><p name="c7eb" id="c7eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Visual effects, music, and ….?</p><p name="22f2" id="22f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Please do not say Kylo and his struggle with light.</p><p name="38a1" id="38a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That is the most shoehorned drama ever created and I can’t believe people falling into that trap.</p><h3 name="9306" id="9306" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Kylo and why the fuck should I care</h3><figure name="1c21" id="1c21" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*qeW73jrLEg6ytJyeKMx2Sw.jpeg" data-width="738" data-height="417" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qeW73jrLEg6ytJyeKMx2Sw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Exactly why I don’t give a shit about Kylo Ren</figcaption></figure><p name="0bd1" id="0bd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As with Rey, Jar Jar Abrams is trolling everyone by letting Kylo kill his father, and let him get away with it.</p><p name="6724" id="6724" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The moment he did this, I knew he is beyond saving and TLJ confirms that this path is what he wanted all along.</p><p name="a3c4" id="a3c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Look at the popularity and attention this character gets. He killed off Han-Solo, blowing up his mother to space and causing Luke to go into exile for decades and eventually die in TLJ.</p><p name="4939" id="4939" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He is personally responsible for the demise of all of the trinity from OT, and he is behaving like an emo, spoiled brat for two episodes now, and people like him and support him?</p><p name="f394" id="f394" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not for me.</p><p name="dfa5" id="dfa5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The depths of this character is ridiculous. Appreciating the actor is one thing, but to say the character has inner struggling with light and dark and have pity for him is another.</p><p name="d2d3" id="d2d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Killing one’s father is not a struggle between light and dark, it is the murder of worst kind in any galaxy. And he certainly does not deserve any kind of praise. Praise for what? He is able to resist the temptation to NOT kill his parents? his classmates? his uncle?</p><p name="6474" id="6474" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hilarious people expecting him to turn to the light, or be involved in a romance with Rey. He should die for killing Han alone, and the plot for Rey to turn him to light is again dumb shit, happily ever after for a murderer? Rey was there when he killed Hen! And after some Skypes they are BFF now?</p><p name="f062" id="f062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, you would lay down Vader card. If Vader is redeemable, so must be Kylo.</p><p name="4baa" id="4baa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is bullshit for two reasons:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="52ff" id="52ff" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Vader does not kill Han. This is the cleaver thing about his image. He is bad-ass, but people you saw him kill were mostly empire officers, not the people you care about, and in the process it asserts his authority and intimidation.</li><li name="9e1d" id="9e1d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Vader is redeemed with his life.</li></ol><p name="ce7b" id="ce7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For Ben’s arc, I think he is beyond redeemable once he crosses that line and kills Han. Although it is possible for a copy-cat director such as Jar Jar to cross that line for publicity stunt and give some lame-ass reasons like struggling between light and dark to gain some sympathy and people would walk into that trap.</p><p name="9b61" id="9b61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evidence in TLJ suggests that his arc is more of a galaxy-domination villain arc, given that he wanted to rule the galaxy even after Snoke diedIt</p><p name="4d81" id="4d81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It also explains why Luke has to hide like a coward, and the creating distraction for rebels to escape subplot; otherwise Kylo would just die in duel and that would be too inconvenient to the plot.</p><p name="f64a" id="f64a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just like you need to tell more lies to cover a lie, you need more plot holes to cover a plot hole. The easiest way for Disney to create a villain with enough drama potential is of course through Leia’s child. It took me 0.5 seconds to come up with this idea. It shows how lazy Disney was when planning a new trilogy and we should not be surprised when this plot line start to fall apart in TLJ.</p><p name="ae77" id="ae77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For Kylo to become a villain, Luke has to go for obvious reasons. But you cannot kill Luke offscreen or without some heroic fight. Easy, an exile for whatever bullshit reasons. This took me another 0.5 seconds. Coming up a good reason for exile would take much more time, but it doesn’t really matter. Star Wars fans are known for fighting against everything outside OT. Blame it on fans!</p><p name="8070" id="8070" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then one dumb shit after another, it becomes the TLJ as we know it.</p><p name="f6ea" id="f6ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jar Jar Abrams is cleaver in that he simply hides all details, and makes TFA look like a reboot to draw people’s attention to goose chase like Rey’s lineage or is it a reboot and use Luke’s inevitable missing as a plot point.</p><p name="2e4b" id="2e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In hindsight, I should have seen this coming. Luke would appear to be busy struggling with something that does not impact the plot in anyway. Of course they would create smokescreen that make everything interconnected and every action matters. Fight Star War fans with buy-out critics and misguided Star War fans.</p><p name="b9f9" id="b9f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luke simply cannot be of any importance, the only logical action for Luke is to kill off Kylo and the new trilogy with it.</p><p name="30a5" id="30a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Admiral Ackbar tried to warn us, but was quickly silenced. Let’s pay the man the respect he deserves and say it out loud:</p><figure name="26a7" id="26a7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aDHQpYQweInlZigt_iJjrQ.jpeg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aDHQpYQweInlZigt_iJjrQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Disney’s plot to destroy Jedi</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
